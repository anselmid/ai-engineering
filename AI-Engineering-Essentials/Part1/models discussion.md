# Review of Different Model Offers

## Model Comparisons

**ChatGPT** is great for general purpose use cases e.g. chatbots and summarization tasks, and the documentation is good.

**Claude** is good for coding and maths activities, and writing content in general. It is also very good at summarizing articles, deep analysis, planning activities and strategic analysis. While ChatGPT gives simple code for coding, Claude generates object oriented and more complex code.

**Google's Gemini** models excel at multi-model activities plus you get the benefit of integration with Google ecosystem e.g. YouTube and Drive. Multimodal models are AI deep-learning models that simultaneously process different modalities, such as text, video, audio, and image, to generate outputs. Multimodal frameworks contain mechanisms to integrate multimodal data collected from multiple sources for more context-specific and comprehensive understanding.

**LLaMA** from Meta is open source (or more accurately open weight). It is very efficient and good at chat and general purpose activities. Also available for download.

**Frontier** from mistral.ai is an open weights model and can run on Ollama. They are smaller models that are highly capable so very efficient.

**Cohere** are more specialised toward RAG applications. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) models are AI systems that combine a retrieval system with a generative language model to produce more accurate and up-to-date responses. Before generating a response, the RAG system first retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge source, then uses that information to "augment" the prompt before the large language model generates its output. This process grounds the LLM's response in factual data and allows it to access information beyond its original training data.

**Stability.ai** is great for generating photos, video and audio. They are also open weight models that can be downloaded locally. Slightly better than OpenAI and Claude for these tasks.

## Frontier Models

At the cutting edge of technology. They are the highest performing models on every LLM benchmark.

**OpenAI** are at the top of the list, with GPT-4 out-performing everyone. o1 and o3-mini are their reasoning models.

**Anthropic** is on par with OpenAI. Claude 3.5 Sonnet out performs ChatGPT on coding and math tasks. Haiku is their smaller model and Opus is their largest model with Sonnet in the middle being their best performing model.

**Google** is on par with both the above. They were behind at the beginning but have made great progress with their Gemini 1.5 Flash model. 1.5 Pro is a larger model than Flash but people tend to prefer Flash.

All are closed source.

## Open Source Models

**Hugging Face** contains a lot of open source machine learning and LLM models in general. They won't out-perform frontier models generally but on some specific tasks they do, and are useful when you are concerned about security.

**Ollama** allows you to download open source models.

## Web Search Models

**ChatGPT and Anthropic** have web search models.

**Tavily.com** is a very useful tool where you can use an API to search the web and return results tailored for LLMs and RAG.

**Perplexity.ai** is another tool. It allows you to chat with different LLMs (e.g. Claude or ChatGPT) and it augments the responses using search results from the web. Perplexity released this before the Frontier models supported web search.

**SerpAPI.com** is an API that you can use to search using Google, and it returns the results in JSON i.e. the same results as if you had entered the search in a browser. It is useful if you want a more deterministic result from a web search.

**SearchAPI.io** is the same as SerpAPI.
